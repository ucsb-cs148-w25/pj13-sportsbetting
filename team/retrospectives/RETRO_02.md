# Date of Retrospective: 02/14/25  

* **Led by:** Thomas So  
* **Present:** Daniel Hwang, Colin Baylis, Jonathan Zhang, Andy Jin, Thomas So, Bryce Wang, Ryan Vo  
* **Absent:**  

## Action Items  

* **A goal:** Improve task estimation accuracy to reduce unfinished work by the end of a sprint.  
* **A change/experiment:** Hold short daily check-ins (async or live) to ensure everyone stays on track and can raise blockers earlier.  
* **A measurement:** Track how many tasks are completed vs. left unfinished at the end of the sprint.  

## Optional  

* Encouraging more collaboration between team members when facing blockers.  
* More structured discussions to prevent retros from going off-topic.  

## Retro Assessment  

### Start/Stop/Continue  
- **Start:** Doing daily async check-ins to improve visibility on progress.  
- **Stop:** Letting tasks remain in "In Progress" for too long without updates.  
- **Continue:** Making sure everyone has an assigned task and is actively working on something.  

* Everyoneâ€™s voice was heard, and discussions remained focused on improvement.  
* We should make sure that when blockers arise, team members feel comfortable asking for help sooner.  

## Experiment/Change  

* We will begin implementing async daily check-ins using messages.  
* This should help us track progress more effectively and address roadblocks faster.  
* We will assess in the next retro if this has improved workflow efficiency.  

## Experiment/Change

* We introduced async daily check-ins via messages to improve progress tracking and address roadblocks faster.
* This change helped keep track of task status and allowed team members to raise problems sooner, reducing delays.
* Moving forward, we will continue with async daily check-ins as they have improved workflow efficiency and sprint completion rates.
