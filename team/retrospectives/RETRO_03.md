# Retro Outcomes - Retro 3

**Date of Retrospective:** 03/01/25

**Process Used:**  
We utilized a Start/Stop/Continue approach to review our progress over the quarter. This method helped us clearly identify what to begin doing, what to stop doing, and what practices to continue.

## Report

### Successes
- **Clear Communication:** Our daily updates (even if asynchronous) have kept everyone informed.
- **Focused Task Allocation:** Each team member consistently had assigned tasks, ensuring that work was evenly distributed.
- **Proactive Problem-Solving:** Blockers were addressed faster thanks to open communication channels.

### Goal
- **Improve Task Estimation:** We want to refine our task estimation accuracy to reduce the number of unfinished tasks by the end of each sprint.

### Commitment
- **Implement Daily Async Check-Ins:** The team pledges to hold short daily check-ins (via messaging or live) to ensure progress is tracked and any blockers are raised early.

## Additional Notes

- **Collaboration Enhancement:** We encourage more collaboration between team members when facing blockers.
- **Structured Discussions:** Future retrospectives will have a more structured agenda to keep discussions focused and efficient.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Everyoneâ€™s voice was heard, and this inclusiveness will be maintained in future meetings.
