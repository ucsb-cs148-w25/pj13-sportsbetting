Using Jest testing library. Created a unit test on our bet parser function. Tests to make sure
the function can parse a bet string and return the correct bet object. Run the test with the
command `npm test`.

## Unit Testing Implementation
For our initial unit testing requirements, we used Jest to test our betting script functionality. Specifically, we implemented a unit test that checks if our API response parser correctly formats betting data into our backend's required structure. The test verifies that given a raw API response (with stuff like odds, teams, and timestamps), it properly extracts and organizes the data into a format our system can use.

The main test file (`script.test.js`) includes test cases that:
- Verify successful parsing of valid betting data
- Handle empty bookmaker arrays gracefully
- Deal with malformed data without crashing

```javascript
describe('Betting API Parser', () => {
    test('parse_api_response correctly formats betting data', async () => {
        const result = await parse_api_response(test_api_response);
        expect(result).toEqual(expected_parse_api_response_output);
    });
    // ... other test cases
});
```

## Future Unit Testing Plans
Let's be real - while 100% test coverage would be nice in theory, we're focusing our unit testing efforts where they matter most:
- Core data processing functions (like the betting parser)
- Critical user-facing calculations (odds processing, payout logic)
- Edge cases that could break the app

We're not going to unit test every single component because:
1. Our dev timeline is tight
2. Some parts change too frequently to maintain tests
3. Integration tests sometimes give us better value for time spent

## Integration Testing Implementation
We've added a basic integration test using Jest that verifies our betting script components work together correctly. The test (`script.integration.test.js`) checks that:
- The script can be imported correctly
- Components can communicate with each other
- The basic betting cycle flows properly

While simple, this test ensures our core modules play nice together and catches any major integration issues.

## Future Integration Testing Plans
Going forward, we're planning to:
- Add more comprehensive integration tests for user workflows
- Focus on critical paths (bet placement -> processing -> payout)
- Maybe add some end-to-end tests if time permits

However, we're keeping it pragmatic. Full end-to-end testing would be overkill for our project scope and timeline. We'll stick to integration tests that give us the most bang for our buck in terms of catching real issues users might face.
