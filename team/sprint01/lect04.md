Scribed Discussion: We are discussing what we want to include in our MVP and added the necessary user stories to our Kanban board, delegating each task to a member. Checked in our teams experiences with our tech stack (React, Node.js, Firebase), added this in LEARNING.md. There are no roadblocks. Everyone will continue to work on lab02.
