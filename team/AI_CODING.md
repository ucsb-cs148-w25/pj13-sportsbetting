Jonathan - I used Claude AI through Cursor IDE to help develop our sports betting app's UI and functionality.

Key Uses:

- Generated React component templates (BetSlip, OddsDisplay, etc.)
- Assisted with API integration and real-time data handling
- Provided Redux state management patterns

Benefits:

- Faster initial development
- Consistent code patterns
- Helpful error handling suggestions

Code Quality Verification:

- Required manual code review and testing
- Needed customization for specific requirements
- Had to verify license compliance

Future Potential:

- Generate test cases
- Debug complex issues
- Explore alternative implementation approaches
- Document AI usage


### Thomas - I used Github Copilot in VScode

Uses:

- Helped generate front-end code through prompting
- Refactored code based on my needs
- Kept track of patterns in different files

Verify:

- Manually tested each code change
- Made sure to read docs and understand each line
- Github Copilot also explains each code generation

### Andy - Used GPT4o in creating a working CI/CD pipeline
- I used chatgpt's state of the art model to create a github action workflow.
- Chatgpt is very useful in creating simple scripts like the github workflow yaml file. Chatgpt will also be very useful when coding with little experience on the tech stack.
- The first couple of workflows did not work because chatgpt doesn't have my entire project configuration. Therefore, it was necessary for me to fix the pipeline a few times for it to properly work.

### Daniel - Used GPT-4o creating foundational UI
- I used OpenAI's GPT-4o model to help create the UI of the sportsbook.css page
- Honestly, with the correct descriptions, GPT can defintely provide a foundational format of what you want your page to look like. From there, I added in my personal taste to help tailor the website to the vision I have.
- I verified the code it gave me by testing each snippet of code, and asking GPT to provide comments to understand what it did.
