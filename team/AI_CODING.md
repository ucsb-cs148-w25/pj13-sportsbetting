Jonathan - I used Claude AI through Cursor IDE to help develop our sports betting app's UI and functionality.

Key Uses:

- Generated React component templates (BetSlip, OddsDisplay, etc.)
- Assisted with API integration and real-time data handling
- Provided Redux state management patterns

Benefits:

- Faster initial development
- Consistent code patterns
- Helpful error handling suggestions

Code Quality Verification:

- Required manual code review and testing
- Needed customization for specific requirements
- Had to verify license compliance

Future Potential:

- Generate test cases
- Debug complex issues
- Explore alternative implementation approaches
- Document AI usage


### Thomas - I used Github Copilot in VScode

Uses:

- Helped generate front-end code through prompting
- Refactored code based on my needs
- Kept track of patterns in different files

Verify:

- Manually tested each code change
- Made sure to read docs and understand each line
- Github Copilot also explains each code generation
