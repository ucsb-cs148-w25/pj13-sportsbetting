Jonathan - I used Claude AI through Cursor IDE to help develop our sports betting app's UI and functionality.

Key Uses:

- Generated React component templates (BetSlip, OddsDisplay, etc.)
- Assisted with API integration and real-time data handling
- Provided Redux state management patterns

Benefits:

- Faster initial development
- Consistent code patterns
- Helpful error handling suggestions

Code Quality Verification:

- Required manual code review and testing
- Needed customization for specific requirements
- Had to verify license compliance

Future Potential:

- Generate test cases
- Debug complex issues
- Explore alternative implementation approaches
- Document AI usage


### Thomas - I used Github Copilot in VScode

Uses:

- Helped generate front-end code through prompting
- Refactored code based on my needs
- Kept track of patterns in different files

Verify:

- Manually tested each code change
- Made sure to read docs and understand each line
- Github Copilot also explains each code generation

### Andy - Used GPT4o in creating a working CI/CD pipeline
- I used chatgpt's state of the art model to create a github action workflow.
- Chatgpt is very useful in creating simple scripts like the github workflow yaml file. Chatgpt will also be very useful when coding with little experience on the tech stack.
- The first couple of workflows did not work because chatgpt doesn't have my entire project configuration. Therefore, it was necessary for me to fix the pipeline a few times for it to properly work.

### Daniel - Used GPT-4o creating foundational UI
- I used OpenAI's GPT-4o model to help create the UI of the sportsbook.css page
- Honestly, with the correct descriptions, GPT can defintely provide a foundational format of what you want your page to look like. From there, I added in my personal taste to help tailor the website to the vision I have.
- I verified the code it gave me by testing each snippet of code, and asking GPT to provide comments to understand what it did.

### Bryce - Used Claude for designing UI
- I used Claude to help me design the leaderboard page to make it look better.
- The UI it created helped to make the page look much nicer by giving me several options for designs that I could choose and select from.
- This tool was very helpful since I find it hard to make the UI look good.
- All I had to do to make sure that the code was correct was run each design and see if it matched the description it gave me. If there was anything that didn't look how it was supposed to, I could just describe the visual differences and it would fix it.
