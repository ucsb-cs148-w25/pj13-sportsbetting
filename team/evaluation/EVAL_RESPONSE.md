# Evaluation Response

## 1. Decisions regarding feedback on USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md

### User Preference Between Two Designs
The feedback consistently indicates that users appreciate our current minimal, clean betting interface but would also value the option to see more detailed statistics when needed. Based on this feedback, we plan to:
- Keep the current clean UI as the default view
- Add an expandable or "More Info" option that allows users to view additional statistics for each game/matchup
- Ensure this optional stats view doesn't clutter the main interface

### User Satisfaction With the Betting Experience
Users found placing bets intuitive and easy, but consistently struggled with checking their balance and viewing results. To address this, we will:
- Add a visible balance indicator in the navigation bar
- Create a dedicated "Your Bets" section separate from the Profile page
- Implement visual indicators on games that the user has already bet on
- Improve the results viewing experience with clearer navigation

### Effectiveness of Leaderboards
While users found the leaderboard concept motivating, several improvements were suggested:
- Add a feature to automatically scroll to or highlight the user's position on the leaderboard
- Implement Friend Group leaderboards to enable competition among friends
- Consider weekly leaderboards with rewards for top performers
- Improve the visual design of the leaderboard page to make it more engaging

## 2. Additional decisions based on feedback

### Feature Understanding and Improvements (Section 2)
Reviewers accurately understood our core features (betting, leaderboard competition, and injury reports). Based on their feedback, we will:
- Create a more cohesive theme across all pages (reviewers noted the betting page was dark mode while other pages were light mode)
- Improve the FriendGroup feature implementation and make it more prominent
- Add the ability to view the website content (leaderboard, current bets) without logging in

### Project Effectiveness (Section 3)
Reviewers found our app functional but noted several UX improvements needed:
- Implement consistent UI/UX design across all pages
- Remove or update the empty Sportsbook page from the navigation (either implement it or mark as "Coming Soon")
- Make the login page design more consistent with the rest of the site

### Deployment and Repository Organization (Section 4)
Reviewers found our deployment and repository structure satisfactory, but suggested:
- Add the deployed website link to the README.md for easier access
- Address the API key security issue by removing public access to the Google Doc containing keys
- Consider organizing Kanban board tasks by sprint for better tracking

### Closing Thoughts (Section 5)
Reviewers generally appreciated our UI and concept, with the main opportunities for improvement being:
- Enhancing the UX consistency across the entire application
- Better security practices for API keys
- Further development of the social aspects (friend groups, leaderboards)
