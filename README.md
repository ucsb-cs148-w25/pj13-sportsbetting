# BetBuddies

### Project Description

**BetBuddies** is a competitive sports betting app where users compete against friends using _fake money_ to see whoâ€™s the best sports bettor. This app simulates real-world sports betting scenarios while keeping it fun and risk-free. The goal is to create an engaging platform where friends can enjoy sports events and friendly competition without financial stakes.

---

### Web App Tech Stack

React, Node.js, Firebase

---

### User Roles

Our app will only have 2 kinds of user, sports bettors and admins to oversee the individual groups that people will compete in. Admins can invite people to groups or kick them out, as well as set all the rules for that group such as start and end time, starting money, etc.
